# Light-Intensity-Analyzer

While trying to think of something which can relate to visualising daily phenomena , sensing it and analysing it on a screen, we finally ended up landing on the idea of visualising the intensity of light on a screen.
For this, we used Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) , Resistor, BOLT.

Applications :
We can use it on a cricket pitch to detect the level of light intensity and tweet or post updates on it on social media in real time.
It can trigger posts if the light level is low and match can't happen.
