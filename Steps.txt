Steps :

1. Circuit Diagram :
	The circuit (including LDR, Resistor ) was made on BOLT . The BOLT was connected to the laptop via a cable and code was uploaded on BOLT.

2. Plotting real-time graphs using ThingSpeak
	The graphs of (intensity VS time) and (light-temperature) curves were plotted through Thingspeak.

3. Triggering on Twitter
	A tweeter triggering was also done.
	A post is posted on Twitter every time it sees the intensity of light crossing a certain limit.
